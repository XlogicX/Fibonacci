# Fibonacci
Generate Fibonacci Sequence using python and some worst practices for coding

# Some Terrible Coding Exhibits
* Inconsistent whitespace in assignments and expressions
* unused variable: errcnt and string (declared in nonsensical area of code)
* unused subroutine/deadcode: nofloats
* unused imports: time, sys, and math(indirectly from dead code)
* code parroting comments for most of the comments
* incorrect comments for hwmny assignment and confusing comments for errchck subroutine
* all variables are global
* unessesarily removed vowels from variables
* variable names describe their data type, not their function
* overcomplicated expression for while loop
* gratuitious and unessesary breaks and continues
* numerious and unessesary parameters for errchk routine
* return None used poorly
* zeroints class provides no additional value (code could easily be re-written without it, and easier to read)
* nonsense (though 'correct') error checking (errchk) routine
* algorithm doesn't actually start with 0,1,1 for the sequence, so it's patched into the beginning
* nonsense abuse of regex
* errchk logic is flawed enough to have to patch after 12 numbers of sequence
* unnessesary recursion, even though it should just be a loop (still functionaly however)
